## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-20

### ðŸŽ‰ Initial Production Release

First production-ready release with comprehensive security, authentication, and production deployment support.

### Added

#### Security & Authentication
- Complete authentication system with login/logout functionality
- Cryptographically secure session tokens using `crypto.randomBytes(32)`
- HMAC-SHA256 signature verification for all session tokens
- Rate limiting for login attempts (5 attempts per IP, 15-minute lockout)
- Bcrypt password hashing support with interactive credential generator
- Timing-safe username comparison to prevent timing attacks
- HTTPOnly, Secure, and SameSite cookie configuration
- Session expiration tracking and validation (24-hour lifetime)
- Protected routes via middleware (all routes except `/login` require auth)

#### Error Handling & Validation
- Comprehensive error handling system with typed error classes:
  - `ValidationError` for client input errors (400)
  - `AuthenticationError` for auth failures (401)
  - `RateLimitError` for too many requests (429)
  - `ExternalAPIError` for OpenAI/external service errors (502)
- OpenAI-specific error detection and user-friendly messages
- Structured logging with timestamps and context
- Production-safe error responses (no internal error exposure)
- Input validation system for all API endpoints:
  - Text length validation (max 4096 chars for TTS)
  - Voice selection validation (6 valid options)
  - Speed range validation (0.25-4.0)
  - Filename sanitization
  - Instructions length validation (max 1000 chars)

#### Configuration & Environment
- Environment variable validation on startup
- Production-specific security checks:
  - SESSION_SECRET length requirement (32+ characters)
  - Detection of weak/default passwords
  - HTTPS requirement checks
  - API key format validation
- Interactive credential generation utility (`pnpm run generate-creds`)
- Comprehensive `.env.example` with documentation
- Environment validation script (`pnpm run validate-env`)

#### Documentation
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive production deployment guide (200+ lines)
- `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` - Complete security audit and improvement summary
- `CLAUDE.md` - Development guidance for Claude Code
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines and development workflow
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` - Community guidelines
- `SECURITY.md` - Security policy and vulnerability reporting
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history (this file)
- Updated `README.md` with production readiness checklist

#### Infrastructure
- Docker health checks (30s interval, 3 retries, 40s start period)
- Custom Node.js server with environment validation
- Authentication environment variables in docker-compose
- GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow for automated testing
- GitHub issue and pull request templates

#### Features
- Session-based audio storage (prevents user conflicts)
- Automatic audio cleanup after 24 hours
- Protected cleanup endpoint with secret key authentication
- Improved error messages for TTS endpoints
- Resource cleanup on failures (no file leaks)

### Changed
- Enhanced TTS basic endpoint with full error handling and validation
- Updated package.json with new utility scripts
- Improved docker-compose.yml configuration
- Updated README.md with security features and production sections
- Server startup now validates environment before running

### Breaking Changes
- **Authentication Required**: All routes except `/login` now require authentication
- **SESSION_SECRET Required**: No default fallback value (must be set in environment)
- **AUTH_USERNAME and AUTH_PASSWORD Required**: Must be configured to access the application
- **Production Validation**: Application will not start in production mode without valid configuration

### Security
- Fixed weak session token generation (was using `Math.random()`)
- Fixed missing session validation (tokens were not verified)
- Fixed brute force vulnerability (no rate limiting)
- Fixed timing attack vulnerability (username comparison)
- Fixed default secret usage (SESSION_SECRET now required)
- Added comprehensive input validation across all endpoints
- Added HMAC signature verification for session tokens

### Dependencies Added
- `tsx` (^4.7.0) - For running TypeScript scripts (credential generator)
